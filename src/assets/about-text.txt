"\"Why pH balanced?\nPhizzies bath bombs are all pH balanced to a pH of 6.5-7. Traditional bath bombs are more basic (alkaline)- they have a pH greater than 7. The skin has a pH barrier that is acidic. The acidic nature of the skin allows good bacteria to flourish and prevents the bad bacteria from growing. When the skin is soaking in an alkaline solution (aka in a bath with a traditional bath bomb), the pH barrier of the skin is disrupted, which can unfortunately cause some problems such as skin irritation and dryness. That’s why Phizzies bath bombs were created to be pH balanced- to keep the skin’s pH level regular and healthy.\nWe didn’t want to limit ourselves to just bath bombs, so we also make lip scrubs and will have more products available in the future!\\nAre the lip scrubs pH balanced too?\npH is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) or hydrogen ions (H+) in an aqueous (water) solution. For a substance to have a pH, they need to be put into water. Our lip scrubs are made with sugar, oils, and beeswax, and no water. So our lip scrubs don’t have a pH. When the scrub is put on the lips, the sugar does get in contact with water and dissolves, forming a slightly acidic solution (cite source).\""
